name: quest
description: Compile a long-horizon coding task into ONE objective prompt for a host that drives a goal to done with its own verifier (grok `/goal`, a Codex task) — where the host's harness is the acceptance auditor, so no second supervisor loop is needed. Folds the octopus discipline (verified-not-written "done", no test theater, no speculative building, forced convergence, owner red lines) into the objective text. Use for a single self-contained goal on a goal-capable host; for multi-milestone / cross-host / owner-gated work, or a host that only loops (Claude Code, Cursor, shell), use the loop-graph arm instead.

# quest — one objective, riding the host's own verifier

## What it does & why

Some hosts already drive the graph for you. grok's `/goal` plans acceptance
criteria, works across rounds, and only marks the goal complete after an
**independent adversarial verifier** reproduces the evidence (defaulting to
*refuted* if it can't). A Codex task self-drives an objective to done across rounds.
On such a host, generating a separate executor + supervisor + two loops is
redundant — you'd pay tokens to re-describe what the harness enforces for free.

The quest arm instead emits **one objective prompt** and lets the host drive it. Its
whole value is that the objective carries the octopus discipline the host's generic
harness doesn't know — verifiable acceptance criteria, no-test-theater, no
speculative building, forced convergence, owner red lines — so the host's verifier
has something real to check against.

## When to use quest vs loop-graph

Use the **quest arm** when *all* hold:
- one self-contained goal (no strict-ordered milestones with a non-skippable gate);
- the host has a goal command that self-drives to done (**grok `/goal`**, a **Codex
  task**);
- executor and reviewer live in the **same** run (you're not splitting them across
  hosts/models);
- no owner-only decision sits on the goal's critical path.

Use the **[loop-graph arm](../loop-graph)** when *any* hold: multi-milestone phases,
executor and supervisor on different hosts/models/cadences, owner red-lines/gates
that must stop the run, cross-session durability, or a host that **only loops** and
has no goal command (**Claude Code**, **Cursor**, shell) — there loop-graph supplies
the verifier as the supervisor node. See [`host-dialects.md`](../../lib/host-dialects.md) for which host
has what.

## How to run it

**Step 1 — Interview** (fill the blanks, don't assume; surface tradeoffs, don't
silently pick). Ask in order — skip only if context already answers:

1. **Host** — where does the goal run? (**grok `/goal`**, a **Codex task**). This
   picks the invocation dialect ([`host-dialects.md`](../../lib/host-dialects.md)). If the host has **no**
   goal command — Claude Code, Cursor, shell — stop and switch to the loop-graph arm.
2. **Objective** — the goal in one sentence.
3. **Acceptance criteria** — the North Star, each as a check the host's verifier can
   **reproduce without the agent**: a command that must pass, or an artifact at a
   persistent path showing a bar met on a named eval set. Push until every criterion
   is checkable ("`make test` green", "scorecard ≥ X on the frozen set"), not "make
   it work". This is the single most important step — grok's verifier defaults to
   *refuted* on anything it can't reproduce, and a Codex task has no separate refuter
   at all, so the criteria are your only guardrail there.
4. **Red lines** — the non-negotiables that halt the work (push/commit auth,
   destructive ops, secrets/real data, frozen contracts, metrics-only-go-up).
5. **Expensive-op guard** — is there a full-cohort eval / bulk sweep / migration? If
   so, it pilots first.

**Milestone check.** If the answers reveal strict-ordered phases with a gate, or an
owner-only call on the critical path, say so and switch to the loop-graph arm — the
quest arm deliberately has no gate and no owner-stop loop.

**Step 2 — Fill the template.** Copy [`templates/quest.md`](templates/quest.md), replace every
`{{PLACEHOLDER}}`, delete the guidance comments. Interview in the user's language and
mirror it in the prose; keep structural headings as in the template.

**Step 3 — Deliver.** Hand the filled objective to the host's goal command, and tell
the user how **in the chat** (print it, don't assume this session is the host):

- **grok:** `/goal <the filled objective>` — optionally `--budget <tokens>`. Manage
  with `/goal status` · `pause` · `resume` · `clear`.
- **Codex:** delegate a task with the filled objective as its brief; it self-drives
  across rounds. Since there's no separate refuter, the objective's acceptance
  criteria carry the whole verification burden — make them reproducible.

Optional reliability upgrade on grok (from [`host-dialects.md`](../../lib/host-dialects.md)): a `Stop`
hook to hold the turn open until a gate passes; a `Notification` hook to ping the
owner when the goal parks on a real blocker.

**Durability note.** A goal harness's state is ephemeral (grok's scratch dir is
deleted when the goal ends). If the goal must survive across sessions or you want an
inspectable scoreboard, also seed a `ledger.md` from the loop-graph arm's template
and tell the objective to keep it current — but that is the seam where you should
probably be using the loop-graph arm outright.
